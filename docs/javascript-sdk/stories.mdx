### Standard Usage 

Use this script in case you want to make the stories relaunch and get it by new product id:

Replace `{{PUBLISH_ID}}` with your project publish id.

Replace `{{PRODUCT_ID}}` with your product id.

Replace `{{VARIANT_ID}}` with your variant id to sort the videos by the variant id (works if videos were tagged with variants and not just the product).

```javascript
  window.tolstoyWidget?.['{{PUBLISH_ID}}']?.init('{{PROUDUCT_ID}},{{VARIANT_ID}}')
```

### Enhanced Usage with Data-Tag Support

or hybrid collection/product pages where you need to update both product ID and Shopify tags:

```
window.tolstoyWidget?.['{{PUBLISH_ID}}']?.init({
  productId: '{{PRODUCT_ID}}',
  tags: 'tag1,tag2,tag3'
});
```
