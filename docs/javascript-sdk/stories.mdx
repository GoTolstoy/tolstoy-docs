Use this script in case you want to make the stories relaunch and get it by new product id:

Replace `{{PUBLISH_ID}}` with your project publish id.

Replace `{{PRODUCT_ID}}` with your product id.

Replace `{{VARIANT_ID}}` with your variant id to sort the videos by the variant id (works if videos were tagged with variants and not just the product).



```javascript
  window.tolstoyWidget?.['{{PUBLISH_ID}}']?.init('{{PROUDUCT_ID}},{{VARIANT_ID}}')
```
